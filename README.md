# spidex-challenge-test


Notes

1 - Import the JUNIT library (either manually or via Maven) add a JUNIT test which checks that the code the “Add Car” button call to add the car to the model correctly. Add a similar test for “Delete Car”.

I added unit test cases for MockDataService as you can see under the test package. (Add Car and Remove Car) and I also can use selenium for testing. 
(I don't know that you wanted me to do this like using selenium tools just in case I can add test cases using selenium or karate framework if you want)

2 - New Feature Add a further new feature you think is missing. Explain what it is and why you decided to implement it.

  1. I think that if we're able to remove any car or add new car. I assume that we have an authorization for these functionality. according to this;
      a. We can add update page
      b. We can add diagram pages based on price and year for clarifying what's going on any specific car models. 
      c. We can add bid feature. for example we can sell any car with bid. This feature works real-time and we can define specific time range. Whoever makes the highest bid will sell the car.
      
      
      
 3. Architecture Task 
        1 - It's written by documents not mandatory. but I've been reading documentations. because I need to learn that what happened nowadays as a best practice. 
        2 - If you want me to provide I can do this as soon as possible
